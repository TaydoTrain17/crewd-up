# Crew'd Up Product Brief

## Mission
Deliver a six-minute, three-round party game that helps 3-6 friends spin up memorable nights with minimal friction.

## Target audience
Urban friend groups aged 18-30 who already coordinate hangs over group chats and expect quick, mobile-first experiences. The product respects a 16+ age gate and filters mature prompts by default.

## Core loop
1. Host creates a room and shares a deep link (24/7, no time gate).
2. Friends join, pick nicknames, and ready up in a 90s countdown lobby or run solo Practice Mode with bots.
3. Three rounds play automatically: Hot Take poll, Callout vote, Dare or Roast text.
4. Recap card is generated, shared, and awards the host an invite token (Practice recaps flagged).

## Differentiators

- NYC-flavored prompt catalog with borough and nightlife tags.
- Safety-first defaults: moderation edge function, quick client slur filter, host boot and block tools.
